# Airport-Data-Set
This program, titled "Program 27", is designed to analyze flight data specific to LAX (Los Angeles International Airport). It calculates and visualizes average flight delays and cancellations over different months. The dataset is expected to be in CSV format.

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following Python libraries:

1.) pandas
2.) matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas matplotlib

To execute the program, run the Python file and provide the name of the CSV file when prompted:
"python program27.py"

Ensure that the CSV file is in the correct format, with columns labeled 'Delayed', 'Cancelled', and 'Month'.

Features:

Reads flight data from a user-specified CSV file.
Calculates the average number of delayed and cancelled flights.
Plots a graph showing the number of delayed and cancelled flights across different months.

Output:
The program outputs the average delays and cancellations to the console.
It also generates a plot saved as output_fig.png, which visualizes the data.

Data Format:
The CSV file should have at least the following columns:

Delayed: Number of delayed flights.
Cancelled: Number of cancelled flights.
Month: Corresponding month for the flight data.
